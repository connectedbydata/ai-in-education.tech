The Workshop in a Box has been created by [Connected by Data](https://connectedbydata.org/) for the Department for Education with input from independent experts on Artificial Intelligence in education. 

We believe that children, young people, families and educators all have the right to have a say on the future uses of Artificial Intelligence in education. This resource is here to help you have an informed discussion about the pros and cons of AI: and to develop and share your own views on AI.
